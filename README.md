# School Catalog
The project was originally designed as a console-accessible core catalog for the Programming Environments and Tools topic with database functionality. After that, the project evolved into a more advanced web application. \
It was created using the Java programming language and the following advanced components:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>GUI</strong> - the graphic interface web-based that has all the functionalities of the catalog ( Made with the Angular framework and the Tailwind CSS framework )
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Networking</strong> - the communication between client and server ( Made with the Dropwizard framework )
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Database</strong> - the data that the server will use will be handled by a database ( Made with JPA )
  </li>
</ul>
